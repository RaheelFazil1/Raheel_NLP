Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning: Approach and Model Architecture

For the sentiment analysis task on movie reviews using deep learning, I followed a systematic approach to preprocess the data, design a suitable neural network architecture, and address various challenges that arose during the process. Here's an overview of my approach:

Data Preprocessing:
I started by loading the IMDb movie reviews dataset containing 50,000 reviews labeled as positive or negative. To prepare the text data for model input, I performed tokenization to split the reviews into individual words, and then applied padding to ensure uniform input sequence lengths. This preprocessing step allowed me to create numerical representations of the review texts suitable for deep learning models.

Model Architecture:
For the neural network architecture, I chose to use a Sequential model from TensorFlow/Keras. The model consisted of an embedding layer followed by dense layers. The embedding layer learned meaningful representations of words from the text data. Subsequent dense layers with appropriate activation functions helped capture complex relationships within the data.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:

Overfitting: One of the challenges was overfitting, where the model performed well on the training data but poorly on the validation set. To mitigate this, I used techniques like dropout and early stopping. Dropout helped prevent the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons, promoting better generalization. Early stopping halted training when validation loss stopped improving, preventing overfitting.

Validation Loss Divergence: I encountered a situation where the validation loss started increasing while the training loss decreased. To address this, I adjusted the model's training epocs and reduced these.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, my approach to sentiment analysis involved data preprocessing, model architecture design, and addressing challenges related to overfitting and validation loss divergence. The neural network model successfully learned sentiment patterns from the text data and achieved competitive accuracy on both the training and validation sets. By iteratively fine-tuning the model architecture and experimenting with different strategies, I was able to build a reliable sentiment analysis solution.
